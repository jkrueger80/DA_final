The conversation around the Too Big to Fail (TBTF) hypothesis gained momentum after the 1984 incident involving Continental Illinois Bank, then the seventh-largest bank in the world. Facing potential collapse, the U.S. government stepped in with a $1 billion recovery fund to stabilize the financial system.  This event raised critical questions about how large banks behave when they are perceived as insusceptible to the financial system, long before the 2008 financial crisis reignited these concerns.
	However, what does it mean for a bank to be Too Big to Fail? A TBTF bank holds such systemic importance that its failure would pose a severe threat to the economy, forcing government intervention.  This expectation of support has significantly influenced investor behavior. For instance, O’Hara and Shaw (1990) found that following the Comptroller’s announcement  designating certain banks as TBTF, nine out of eleven of those banks experienced positive stock price changes between 0.29% and 5.56%. These results suggest that TBTF status boosts investor confidence, as shareholders anticipate government bailouts during crises, thereby reinforcing the TBTF narrative. Other researchers (Flannery and Sorescu 1996; Sironi 2003; Morgan and Stiroh 2005; Anginer and Warburton 2010; Balasubramnian and Cyree 2011; Santos) have investigated spreads on bonds, while some have tackled the conversation through the analysis of credit default spreads (Demirgüç-Kunt and Huizinga 2013; Li, Qu, and Zhang 2011), bank stock returns (Correa et al. 2012), and deposit costs (Baker and McArthur 2009). Additionally, some efforts have been made to understand the problem through mergers and acquisitions  (Brewer and Jagtiani 2007; Molyneux, Schaeck, and Zhou 2011), and finally, some have taken a larger-picture view to understand the systemic risk of banks through analyzing Z-score calculations (Brandão Marques, Correa, and Sapriza 2013) (Afonso et al, 2014).
	Economists have long debated how banks respond strategically to TBTF status. A key concern is that banks may take on greater risks if government safety nets will shield them from failure, a classic case of moral hazard. In addition, many banks pursue mergers and acquisitions to increase their size and systemic relevance, which further secures their TBTF status. This perception also makes TBTF banks more attractive to investors, driving up stock prices based on the belief that these institutions are "safer" due to expected government support.
	In response, regulatory frameworks such as the Dodd-Frank Act3 in the United States and the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD)4 in Europe were introduced to increase transparency and reduce systemic risk. These efforts aim to mitigate the dangers posed by TBTF institutions and to strengthen the stability of the global financial system.
	The goal of this research is to understand risk-taking and the TBTF hypothesis through the lens of the current banking industry. With data collected from Bloomberg from 10 banks of varying sizes (JPM, Bank of America, US Bank, Wells Fargo, Ally Bank, Zion Bank, Huntington Bank, Northern Trust, Busey Bank, and Wintrust Financial). I will look to understand what variables affect loan performance. The main assumption about banks in this current economy is that they take excessive risks, and the belief is that this is due to implicit government support. While research has done a fair job of analyzing this, I hope to complicate the conversation as well as reemphasize some of the points that have already been made.
