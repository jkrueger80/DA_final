Beyond Size: Assessing the Risk Appetite of 'Too Big to Fail' 
Overview;

This project was created to help understand the Too Big to Fail (TBTF) hypothesis and the implicit governmetn support that banks receive as a result of being TBTF. The project will use data from 10 different sized banks that have been exported into Excel through the Bloomberg API. THe goal is to use fixed-time panel regression to showcase hose various banks of different size take on risk. By analyzing non-performing loans, non-performing loans, and borrowing costs. I will aim to understand what effects these dependent variables in order to get a better understanding of how banks take risks. 

Description
The conversation around the Too Big to Fail (TBTF) hypothesis gained momentum after the 1984 incident involving Continental Illinois Bank, then the seventh-largest bank in the world. Facing potential collapse, the U.S. government stepped in with a $1 billion recovery fund to stabilize the financial system.¹ This event raised critical questions about how large banks behave when they are perceived as indispensable to the financial system, long before the 2008 financial crisis reignited these concerns.
However, what does it actually mean for a bank to be Too Big to Fail? A TBTF bank holds such systemic importance that its failure would pose a severe threat to the economy, prompting government intervention.² This expectation of support has significantly influenced investor behavior. For instance, O’Hara and Shaw (1990) found that following the Comptroller’s announcement designating certain banks as TBTF, nine out of eleven of those banks experienced positive stock price changes between 0.29% and 5.56%. These results suggest that TBTF status boosts investor confidence, as shareholders anticipate government bailouts during crises, thereby reinforcing the TBTF narrative.
Economists have long debated how banks respond strategically to TBTF status. A key concern is that banks may take on greater risks, assuming that government safety nets will shield them from failure, a classic case of moral hazard.³ In addition, many banks pursue mergers and acquisitions to increase their size and systemic relevance, which further secures their TBTF status. This perception also makes TBTF banks more attractive to investors, driving up stock prices based on the belief that these institutions are "safer" due to expected government support.

In response, regulatory frameworks such as the Dodd-Frank Act in the United States and the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) in Europe were introduced to increase transparency and reduce systemic risk.⁴⁵ These efforts aim to mitigate the dangers posed by TBTF institutions and to strengthen the stability of the global financial system.
This paper categorizes existing literature thematically, based on regional and global perspectives on TBTF. By exploring how large banks leverage their TBTF status, we can better understand the systemic risks and regulatory challenges they present. The ultimate goal is to expand the discussion on how these institutions may act unethically due to the expectation of government bailouts.
